Update PowerShell —
Before diving into scripting or automation, it's essential to update PowerShell to the latest stable version. 
Newer versions bring better performance, more features, improved security, 
and compatibility with modern scripts and modules.

This guide walks through the simplest, most reliable way to upgrade using winget (recommended by Microsoft).

Why Update First?
  •	Older versions (like Windows PowerShell 5.1) are outdated and limited
  •	Many tutorials and modules require PowerShell 7+
  •	PowerShell 7.x is cross-platform, faster, and more powerful

Quick Install Command (Recommended)
If winget is available on your system,just copy and run this on PowerShell:
  
  winget install --id Microsoft.Powershell --source winget
  
This installs the latest PowerShell 7.x stable release side-by-side with Windows PowerShell.

After Installing
Open the new PowerShell 7+ terminal and check the version:
  
  $PSVersionTable
